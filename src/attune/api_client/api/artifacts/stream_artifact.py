    """Stream the latest file-backed artifact version as Server-Sent Events.

     The endpoint:
    1. Waits (up to ~30 s) for the file to appear on disk if it has been
       allocated but not yet written by the worker.
    2. Once the file exists it sends the current content as an initial `content`
       event, then tails the file every 500 ms, sending `append` events with new
       bytes.
    3. When no new bytes have appeared for several consecutive checks **and** the
       linked execution (if any) has reached a terminal status, it sends a `done`
       event and the stream ends.
    4. If the client disconnects the stream is cleaned up automatically.

    **Event types** (SSE `event:` field):
    - `content`  – full file content up to the current offset (sent once)
    - `append`   – incremental bytes appended since the last event
    - `waiting`  – file does not exist yet; sent periodically while waiting
    - `done`     – no more data expected; stream will close
    - `error`    – something went wrong; `data` contains a human-readable message

    Args:
        id (int):

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
        httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
